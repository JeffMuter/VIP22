      Hey United Igniters of VIP22! Our CSP has been kicked into motion! Jon
      Schleicker and Jeff Muter created this website for the team. We will track
      a few different things as well as support the team with important
      information. Below is a chart of how our Enrollment game is going, as well
      as our CSP! On the next page is our list of CSP roles, as well as a list
      of Captains with contact info. Want to know who CSP captains are?
      Enrollment Captains, or who's on the Social Media Team? You can find that
      info there. On the final page is a catelogue of supportive information
      provided by coaches and trainers!
