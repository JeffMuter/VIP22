  <h2>Support</h2>
  <p>
    We as a team have been given a wealth of supportive information traded
    between each other, and normally lost in the stream of messages in GroupMe.
    I've created a collection of supportive links for enrollment and CSP,
    whether podcasts, articles, or videos, I hope you use this to support you
    VIP experience!
